# So you want to contribute!

Thanks for helping out the community! We are actively looking for contributors and maintainers so you are more than welcome.

I thought I should lay out some core principles that we will follow so that this repo doesn't get too wild and lose its value.

1. Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
2. Check your spelling and grammar.
3. Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
4. Please use the following format: `[Title Case Name](link)`.
5. All pull requests should have a useful title and description.

That's all I've got! Again, really happy you are thinking about helping out, who knows, the person who you might be helping is yourself in future!
